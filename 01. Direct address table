-handles search, insert and delete for small number of keys using a bool array.[0-999].
-handle also small range values, like ascii values.
-can't handle large keys and floating point numbers. keys can't be strings also.
-hence we introduce the idea of hashing.

this method is good for simple implementation of insert, delete, search in O(1) time.
