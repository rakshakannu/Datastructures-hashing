# Datastructures-hashing
hashtables always have unique values. does addition, searching and deleting using O[1] on average.
Beats all the other datastructures in time.

Hashing is not used in the following:
- finding closest value   // Avl tree or red black tree 
- sorted data   // Avl tree or red black tree 
- prefix searching   // trie

Applications of hashing:
- dictionaries
- database indexing
- cryptography (to store passwords safely)
- caches
- symbol tables in compilers/ interpreters
- routers
- getting data from databases ...
