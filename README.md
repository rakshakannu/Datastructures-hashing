# Datastructures-hashing
hashtables always have unique values. does addition, searching and deleting using O[1] on average.
Beats all the other datastructures in time.

Hashing is not used in the following:
- finding closest value   // Avl tree or red black tree 
- sorted data   // Avl tree or red black tree 
- prefix searching   // trie

Hashing is expert when it comes to insert, delete, and search which does it in O(1).

Hash table is the data structure that is used to implement hashing. 
it is the second most used datastructure after array.

Applications of hashing:
- dictionaries
- database indexing (hashing or B+ indexing is used for database indexing)
- cryptography (to store passwords safely by good websites)
- caches
- symbol tables in compilers/ interpreters
- routers
- getting data from databases ...
