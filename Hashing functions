// ex- phno(10 power 10), names, emp ids,...(i.e large values) 
// we make a hash table.

How hash functions work?

-should always map the large key to the same small key
-should always generate values from 0 to m-1 (m is the size of hash table)
-should be fast, O[1] for integer and O[length] for strings
-(very imp) should uniformly distribute large keys into hash table slots

Example hash funtions -

1. h(large_key) = large_key % m (for large integers like phone numbers) // m is the closest prime number to the number of keys. 
   Don't take power of 2 or 10. This is not the best hash function.

2. for strings, weighted sum
str[]="abcd"
str[0]*x^0+...+str[3]*x^3

3. Universal hashing - group of hash functions. Randomly pick one hash function and use it. Makes sure that time is O[1].
